In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
THE MOST GRACIOUS
has imparted this Qur’an [unto man].

[before Him] prostrate themselves the stars and the trees.
And the skies has He raised high, and has devised [for all things] a measure,
so that you [too, O men,] might never transgress the measure [of what is right]:
weigh, therefore, [your deeds] with equity, and cut not the measure short!

with fruit thereon, and palm trees with sheathed clusters [of dates],
and grain growing tall on its stalks, and sweet-smelling plants.
