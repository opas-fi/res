In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
SAY: "I seek refuge with the Sustainer of men,
"the Sovereign of men,
"the God of men,
"from the evil of the whispering, elusive tempter
"who whispers in the hearts of men
"from all [temptation to evil by] invisible forces as well as men,"
