In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
SAY: "O you who deny the truth!
"I do not worship that which you worship,
and neither do you worship that which I worship!
"And I will not worship that which you have [ever] worshipped,
and neither will you [ever] worship that which I worship.
Unto you, your moral law, and unto me, mine!"
