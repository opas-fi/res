In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
YOU ARE OBSESSED by greed for more and more
until you go down to your graves.
Nay, in time you will come to understand!
And once again: Nay, in time you will come to understand!
Nay, if you could but understand [it] with an understanding [born] of certainty,
you would indeed, most surely, behold the blazing fire [of hell]!
In the end you will indeed, most surely, behold it with the eye of certainty:
and on that Day you will most surely be called to account for [what you did with] the boon of life!
