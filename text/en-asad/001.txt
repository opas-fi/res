In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
All praise is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,
The Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace,
Lord of the Day of Judgment!
Thee alone do we worship; and unto Thee alone do we turn for aid.
Guide us the straight way.
The way of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings, not of those who have been condemned [by Thee], nor of those who go astray!
