In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Dispenser of Grace:
WOE unto every slanderer, fault-finder!
[Woe unto him who amasses wealth and counts it a safeguard,
thinking that his wealth will make him live forever!
Nay, but [in the life to come such as] he shall indeed be abandoned to crushing torment!
And what could make thee conceive what that crushing torment will be?
A fire kindled by God,
which will rise over the [guilty] hearts:
verily, it will close in upon them
in endless columns!
