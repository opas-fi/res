In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
When the sun is put out,
and when the stars fall down,
and when the mountains are blown away,
and when pregnant camels are left untended,
and when wild beasts are gathered together,
and when the seas are set on fire,
and when the souls ˹and their bodies˺ are paired ˹once more˺,
and when baby girls, buried alive, are asked
for what crime they were put to death,
and when the records ˹of deeds˺ are laid open,
and when the sky is stripped away,
and when the Hellfire is fiercely flared up,
and when Paradise is brought near—
˹on that Day˺ each soul will know what ˹deeds˺ it has brought along.
I do swear by the receding stars
which travel and hide,
and the night as it falls
and the day as it breaks!
Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the Word of ˹Allah delivered by Gabriel,˺ a noble messenger-angel,
full of power, held in honour by the Lord of the Throne,
obeyed there ˹in heaven˺, and trustworthy.
And your fellow man is not insane.
And he did see that ˹angel˺ on the clear horizon,
and he does not withhold ˹what is revealed to him of˺ the unseen.
And this ˹Quran˺ is not the word of an outcast devil.
So what ˹other˺ path would you take?
Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world—
to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way.
But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds.
