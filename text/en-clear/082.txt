In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
When the sky splits open,
and when the stars fall away,
and when the seas burst forth,
and when the graves spill out,
˹then˺ each soul will know what it has sent forth or left behind.
O humanity! What has emboldened you against your Lord, the Most Generous,
Who created you, fashioned you, and perfected your design,
moulding you in whatever form He willed?
But no! In fact, you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment,
while you are certainly observed by vigilant,
honourable angels, recording ˹everything˺.
They know whatever you do.
Indeed, the virtuous will be in bliss,
and the wicked will be in Hell,
burning in it on Judgment Day,
and they will have no escape from it.
What will make you realize what Judgment Day is?
Again, what will make you realize what Judgment Day is?
˹It is˺ the Day no soul will be of ˹any˺ benefit to another whatsoever, for all authority on that Day belongs to Allah ˹entirely˺.
