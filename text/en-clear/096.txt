In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—
created humans from a clinging clot.
Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous,
Who taught by the pen—
taught humanity what they knew not.
Most certainly, one exceeds all bounds
once they think they are self-sufficient.
˹But˺ surely to your Lord is the return ˹of all˺.
Have you seen the man who prevents
a servant ˹of Ours˺ from praying?
What if this ˹servant˺ is ˹rightly˺ guided,
or encourages righteousness?
What if that ˹man˺ persists in denial and turns away?
Does he not know that Allah sees ˹all˺?
But no! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag him by the forelock—
a lying, sinful forelock.
So let him call his associates.
We will call the wardens of Hell.
Again, no! Never obey him ˹O Prophet˺! Rather, ˹continue to˺ prostrate and draw near ˹to Allah˺.
