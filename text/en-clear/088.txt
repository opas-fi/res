In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Has the news of the Overwhelming Event reached you ˹O Prophet˺?
On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be downcast,
˹totally˺ overburdened, exhausted,
burning in a scorching Fire,
left to drink from a scalding spring.
They will have no food except a foul, thorny shrub,
neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger.
On that Day ˹other˺ faces will be glowing with bliss,
˹fully˺ pleased with their striving,
in an elevated Garden,
where no idle talk will be heard.
In it will be a running spring,
along with thrones raised high,
and cups set at hand,
and ˹fine˺ cushions lined up,
and ˹splendid˺ carpets spread out.
Do they not ever reflect on camels—how they were ˹masterfully˺ created;
and the sky—how it was raised ˹high˺;
and the mountains—how they were firmly set up;
and the earth—how it was levelled out?
So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O  Prophet˺, for your duty is only to remind.
You are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺.
But whoever turns away, persisting in disbelief,
then Allah will inflict upon them the major punishment.
Surely to Us is their return,
then surely with Us is their reckoning.
