In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the night when it covers,
and the day when it shines!
And by ˹the One˺ Who created male and female!
Surely the ends you strive for are diverse.
As for the one who is charitable, mindful ˹of Allah˺,
and ˹firmly˺ believes in the finest reward,
We will facilitate for them the Way of Ease.
And as for the one who is stingy, indifferent ˹to Allah˺,
and ˹staunchly˺ denies the finest reward,
We will facilitate for them the path of hardship.
And their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they tumble ˹into Hell˺.
It is certainly upon Us ˹alone˺ to show ˹the way to˺ guidance.
And surely to Us ˹alone˺ belong this life and the next.
And so I have warned you of a raging Fire,
in which none will burn except the most wretched—
who deny and turn away.
But the righteous will be spared from it—
who donate ˹some of˺ their wealth only to purify themselves,
not in return for someone’s favours,
but seeking the pleasure of their Lord, the Most High.
They will certainly be pleased.
