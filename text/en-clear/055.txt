In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
The Most Compassionate
taught the Quran,
created humanity,
˹and˺ taught them speech.
The sun and the moon ˹travel˺ with precision.
The stars and the trees bow down ˹in submission˺.
As for the sky, He raised it ˹high˺, and set the balance ˹of justice˺
so that you do not defraud the scales.
Weigh with justice, and do not give short measure.
He laid out the earth for all beings.
In it are fruit, palm trees with date stalks,
and grain with husks, and aromatic plants.
