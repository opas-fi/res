In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the sky full of constellations,
and the promised Day ˹of Judgment˺,
and the witness and what is witnessed!
Condemned are the makers of the ditch—
the fire ˹pit˺, filled with fuel—
when they sat around it,
watching what they had ˹ordered to be˺ done to the believers,
who they resented for no reason other than belief in Allah—the Almighty, the Praiseworthy—
˹the One˺ to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and earth. And Allah is a Witness over all things.
Those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not repent will certainly suffer the punishment of Hell and the torment of burning.
Surely those who believe and do good will have Gardens under which rivers flow. That is the greatest triumph.
Indeed, the ˹crushing˺ grip of your Lord is severe.
˹For˺ He is certainly the One Who originates and resurrects ˹all˺.
And He is the All-Forgiving, All-Loving—
Lord of the Throne, the All-Glorious,
Doer of whatever He wills.
Has the story of the ˹destroyed˺ forces reached you ˹O Prophet˺—
˹the forces of˺ Pharaoh and Thamûd?
Yet the disbelievers ˹still˺ persist in denial.
But Allah encompasses them from all sides.
In fact, this is a glorious Quran,
˹recorded˺ in a Preserved Tablet.
