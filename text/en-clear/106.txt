In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
˹At least˺ for ˹the favour of˺ making Quraysh habitually secure—
secure in their trading caravan ˹to Yemen˺ in the winter and ˹Syria˺ in the summer—
let them worship the Lord of this ˹Sacred˺ House,
Who has fed them against hunger and made them secure against fear.
