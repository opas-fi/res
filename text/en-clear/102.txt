In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺,
until you end up in ˹your˺ graves.
But no! You will soon come to know.
Again, no! You will soon come to know.
Indeed, if you were to know ˹your fate˺ with certainty, ˹you would have acted differently˺.
˹But˺ you will surely see the Hellfire.
Again, you will surely see it with the eye of certainty.
Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about ˹your worldly˺ pleasures.
