In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
I do swear by this city ˹of Mecca˺—
even though you ˹O Prophet˺ are subject to abuse in this city—
and by every parent and ˹their˺ child!
Indeed, We have created humanity in ˹constant˺ struggle.
Do they think that no one has power over them,
boasting, “I have wasted enormous wealth!”?
Do they think that no one sees them?
Have We not given them two eyes,
a tongue, and two lips;
and shown them the two ways ˹of right and wrong˺?
If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺!
And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path is?
It is to free a slave;
or to give food in times of famine
to an orphaned relative
or to a poor person in distress;
and—above all—to be one of those who have faith and urge each other to perseverance and urge each other to compassion.
These are the people of the right.
As for those who deny Our signs, they are the people of the left.
The Fire will be sealed over them.
