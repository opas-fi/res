In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the morning sunlight,
and the night when it falls still!
Your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful ˹of you˺.
And the next life is certainly far better for you than this one.
And ˹surely˺ your Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased.
Did He not find you as an orphan then shelter you?
Did He not find you unguided then guide you?
And did He not find you needy then satisfy your needs?
So do not oppress the orphan,
nor repulse the beggar.
And proclaim the blessings of your Lord.
