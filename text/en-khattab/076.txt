In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Is there not a period of time when each human is nothing yet worth mentioning?
˹For˺ indeed, We ˹alone˺ created humans from a drop of mixed fluids, ˹in order˺ to test them, so We made them hear and see.
We already showed them the Way, whether they ˹choose to˺ be grateful or ungrateful.
Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing Fire.
Indeed, the virtuous will have a drink ˹of pure wine˺—flavoured with camphor—
˹from˺ a spring where Allah’s servants will drink, flowing at their will.
They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of sweeping horror,
and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor, the orphan, and the captive,
˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only for the sake of Allah, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you.
We fear from our Lord a horribly distressful Day.”
So Allah will deliver them from the horror of that Day, and grant them radiance and joy,
and reward them for their perseverance with a Garden ˹in Paradise˺ and ˹garments of˺ silk.
There they will be reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches, never seeing scorching heat or bitter cold.
The Garden’s shade will be right above them, and its fruit will be made very easy to reach.
They will be waited on with silver vessels and cups of crystal—
crystalline silver, filled precisely as desired.
And they will be given a drink ˹of pure wine˺ flavoured with ginger
from a spring there, called Salsabîl.
They will be waited on by eternal youths. If you saw them, you would think they were scattered pearls.
And if you looked around, you would see ˹indescribable˺ bliss and a vast kingdom.
The virtuous will be ˹dressed˺ in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.
˹And they will be told,˺ “All this is surely a reward for you. Your striving has been appreciated.”
Indeed, it is We Who have revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ in stages.
So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not yield to any evildoer or ˹staunch˺ disbeliever from among them.
˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening,
and prostrate before Him during part of the night, and glorify Him long at night.
Surely those ˹pagans˺ love this fleeting world, ˹totally˺ neglecting a weighty Day ahead of them.
It is We Who created them and perfected their ˹physical˺ form. But if We will, We can easily replace them with others.
Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord.
But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
He admits whoever He wills into His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment
