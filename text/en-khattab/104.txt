In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Woe to every backbiter, slanderer,
who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and counts it ˹repeatedly˺,
thinking that their wealth will make them immortal!
Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the Crusher.
And what will make you realize what the Crusher is?
˹It is˺ Allah’s kindled Fire,
which rages over the hearts.
It will be sealed over them,
˹tightly secured˺ with long braces.
