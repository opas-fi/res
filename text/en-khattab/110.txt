In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
When Allah’s ˹ultimate˺ help comes and the victory ˹over Mecca is achieved˺,
and you ˹O Prophet˺ see the people embracing Allah’s Way in crowds,
then glorify the praises of your Lord and seek His forgiveness, for certainly He is ever Accepting of Repentance.
