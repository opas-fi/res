In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists were not going to desist ˹from disbelief˺ until the clear proof came to them:
a messenger from Allah, reciting scrolls of ˹utmost˺ purity,
containing upright commandments.
It was not until this clear proof came to the People of the Book that they became divided ˹about his prophethood˺—
even though they were only commanded to worship Allah ˹alone˺ with sincere devotion to Him in all uprightness, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. That is the upright Way.
Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the worst of ˹all˺ beings.
Indeed, those who believe and do good—they are the best of ˹all˺ beings.
Their reward with their Lord will be Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is ˹only˺ for those in awe of their Lord.
