In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the sun and its brightness,
and the moon as it follows it,
and the day as it unveils it,
and the night as it conceals it!
And by heaven and ˹the One˺ Who built it,
and the earth and ˹the One˺ Who spread it!
And by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it,
then with ˹the knowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it!
Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul,
and doomed is the one who corrupts it!
Thamûd rejected ˹the truth˺ out of arrogance,
when the most wicked of them was roused ˹to kill the she-camel˺.
But the messenger of Allah warned them, “˹Do not disturb˺ Allah’s camel and her ˹turn to˺ drink!”
Still they defied him and slaughtered her. So their Lord crushed them for their crime, levelling all to the ground.
He has no fear of consequences.
