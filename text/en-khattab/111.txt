In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish!
Neither his wealth nor ˹worldly˺ gains will benefit him.
He will burn in a flaming Fire,
and ˹so will˺ his wife, the carrier of ˹thorny˺ kindling,
around her neck will be a rope of palm-fibre.
