In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment?
That is the one who repulses the orphan,
and does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
So woe to those ˹hypocrites˺ who pray
yet are unmindful of their prayers;
those who ˹only˺ show off,
and refuse to give ˹even the simplest˺ aid.
