In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
He frowned and turned ˹his attention˺ away,
˹simply˺ because the blind man came to him ˹interrupting˺.
You never know ˹O Prophet˺, perhaps he may be purified,
or he may be mindful, benefitting from the reminder.
As for the one who was indifferent,
you gave him your ˹undivided˺ attention,
even though you are not to blame if he would not be purified.
But as for the one who came to you, eager ˹to learn˺,
being in awe ˹of Allah˺,
you were inattentive to him.
But no! This ˹revelation˺ is truly a reminder.
So let whoever wills be mindful of it.
It is ˹written˺ on pages held in honour—
highly esteemed, purified—
by the hands of angel-scribes,
honourable and virtuous.
Condemned are ˹disbelieving˺ humans! How ungrateful they are ˹to Allah˺!
From what substance did He create them?
He created them from a sperm-drop, and ordained their development.
Then He makes the way easy for them,
then causes them to die and be buried.
Then when He wills, He will resurrect them.
But no! They have failed to comply with what He ordered.
Let people then consider their food:
how We pour down rain in abundance
and meticulously split the earth open ˹for sprouts˺,
causing grain to grow in it,
as well as grapes and greens,
and olives and palm trees,
and dense orchards,
and fruit and fodder—
all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals.
Then, when the Deafening Blast comes to pass—
on that Day every person will flee from their own siblings,
and ˹even˺ their mother and father,
and ˹even˺ their spouse and children.
For then everyone will have enough concern of their own.
On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright,
laughing and rejoicing,
while ˹other˺ faces will be dusty,
cast in gloom—
those are the disbelievers, the ˹wicked˺ sinners.
