In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the fig and the olive ˹of Jerusalem˺,
and Mount Sinai,
and this secure city ˹of Mecca˺!
Indeed, We created humans in the best form.
But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺,
except those who believe and do good—they will have a never-ending reward.
Now, what makes you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment?
Is Allah not the most just of all judges?
