In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Woe to every slandering backbiter.
Who amasses wealth and counts it over.
Thinking that his wealth has eternalized him.
By no means. He will be thrown into the Crusher.
And what will make you realize what the Crusher is?
Allah's kindled Fire.
That laps to the hearts.
It closes in on them.
In extended columns.
