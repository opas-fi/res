In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity—and calculate their term. And reverence Allah, your Lord. And do not expel them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven indecency. These are the limits set by Allah. Whoever oversteps the limits set by Allah has wronged his own soul. You never know; Allah may afterward bring about a new situation.
Once they have reached their term, either retain them nicely or separate from them nicely. And call to witness two just people from among you. And give upright testimony for Allah. By this is exhorted whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever reverences Allah: He will make a way out for him.
And will provide for him from where he never expected. Whoever relies on Allah: He is enough for him. Allah fulfills His Will. Allah has set a measure for all things.
As for your women who have reached menopause: if you have any doubts, their term shall be three months—as well as for those who are yet to menstruate. As for those who are pregnant: their term shall be until they have delivered. Whoever is conscious of Allah: He will make things easy for him.
That is the command of Allah, which He has revealed to you. Whoever is mindful of Allah: He will remit his sins, and will amplify his reward.
Let them reside where you reside, according to your means. And do not harm them to pressure them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them until they have delivered. And if they nurse for you, compensate them fairly. And maintain your relationship in amity. And if you have difficulty with one another, then let another woman nurse for him.
The wealthy shall spend according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what He has given it. Allah will bring ease after hardship.
How many a society rebelled against the commandments of its Lord and His messengers? So We held it strictly accountable, and We subjected it to a dreadful punishment.
So it tasted the bad consequences of its decisions, and the outcome of its decisions was perdition.
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. So beware of Allah, O you who possess intellect and have believed. Allah has revealed to you a Reminder.
A messenger reciting to you the Clear Verses of Allah, to bring those who believe and work righteousness from darkness into light. Whoever believes in Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah has given him an excellent provision.
Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and from the earth the like thereof. The command descends through them, so you may know that Allah is capable of everything, and that Allah has encompassed everything in knowledge.
