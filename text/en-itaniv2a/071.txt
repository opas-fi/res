In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
We sent Noah to his people: “Warn your people before a painful punishment comes upon them.”
He said, “O my people, I am a clear warner to you.
Worship Allah, and reverence Him, and obey me.
He will forgive you of your sins, and He will delay you until a stated time. Allah’s time cannot be postponed once it has arrived—if you only knew.”
He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and day.
But my call added only to their flight.
And whenever I called them to Your forgiveness, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrapped themselves with their clothes, and insisted, and became more and more arrogant.
Then I called them openly.
Then I appealed to them publicly, and I spoke to them privately.
I said, ‘Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is Forgiving.
He will let loose the sky upon you in abundant rain.
And will supply you with wealth and children, and will give you gardens, and will give you rivers.
What is the matter with you, that you do not hope for Allah with dignity?
Although He created you in stages.
Do you not see how Allah created seven heavens in layers?
And He placed the moon in their midst for light, and He made the sun a lamp.
And Allah germinated you from the earth like plants.
Then He will return you into it, and He will bring you out again.
And Allah made the earth a spread for you.
So that you may travel its diverse roadways.’”
Noah said, “My Lord, they have defied me, and followed him whose wealth and children increase him only in loss.”
And they schemed outrageous schemes.
And they said, “Do not give up your gods; do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor Yaghoos, Yaooq, and Nassr.
They have misled many, so increase the wrongdoers only in confusion.”
Because of their wrongs, they were drowned, then hurled into a Fire, and they found none to help them against Allah.
And Noah said, “My Lord, do not leave a single unbeliever on earth.
If You leave them, they will mislead your worshipers, and breed nothing but immoral unbelievers.
My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home in faith, and the believing men and believing women, and do not increase the wrongdoers except in ruin.”
