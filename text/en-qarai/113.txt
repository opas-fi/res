In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful.
Say, ‘I seek the protection of the Lord of the daybreak
from the evil of what He has created,
and from the evil of the dark night when it falls,
and from the evil of the witches, who blow on knots,
and from the evil of the envious one when he envies.’
