In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
When the earth is shaken ˹in˺ its ultimate quaking,
and when the earth throws out ˹all˺ its contents,[1]
and humanity cries, “What is wrong with it?”—
on that Day the earth will recount everything,
having been inspired by your Lord ˹to do so˺.
On that Day people will proceed in separate groups[1] to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds.
So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.
And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.
