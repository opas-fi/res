In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Have We not uplifted your heart for you ˹O Prophet˺,
relieved you of the burden
which weighed so heavily on your back,
and elevated your renown for you?[1]
So, surely with hardship comes ease.
Surely with ˹that˺ hardship comes ˹more˺ ease.[1]
So once you have fulfilled ˹your duty˺, strive ˹in devotion˺,
turning to your Lord ˹alone˺ with hope.
