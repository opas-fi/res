In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak
from the evil of whatever He has created,
and from the evil of the night when it grows dark,
and from the evil of those ˹witches casting spells by˺ blowing onto knots,
and from the evil of an envier when they envy.”
