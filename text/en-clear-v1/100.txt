In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
’ By the galloping, panting horses,
striking sparks of fire ˹with their hoofs˺,
launching raids at dawn,
stirring up ˹clouds of˺ dust,
and penetrating into the heart of enemy lines!
Surely humankind is ungrateful to their Lord—
and they certainly attest to this—
and they are truly extreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains.
Do they not know that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out,
and the secrets of the hearts will be laid bare—
surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day.
