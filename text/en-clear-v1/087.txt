In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,
Who created and ˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺,
and Who ordained precisely and inspired accordingly,
and Who brings forth ˹green˺ pasture,
then reduces it to withered chaff.
We will have you recite ˹the Quran, O  Prophet,˺ so you will not forget ˹any of it˺,
unless Allah wills otherwise.[1] He surely knows what is open and what is hidden.
We will facilitate for you the Way of Ease.[1]
So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial ˹only to some˺.
Those in awe ˹of Allah˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺.
But it will be shunned by the most wretched,
who will burn in the greatest Fire,
where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die.
Successful indeed are those who purify themselves,
remember the Name of their Lord, and pray.
But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of this world,
even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting.
This is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures—
the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
