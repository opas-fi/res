In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—
created humans from a clinging clot.[1]
Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous,
Who taught by the pen—
taught humanity what they knew not.[1]
Most certainly, one exceeds all bounds
once they think they are self-sufficient.
˹But˺ surely to your Lord is the return ˹of all˺.
Have you seen the man who prevents
a servant ˹of Ours˺ from praying?[1]
What if this ˹servant˺ is ˹rightly˺ guided,
or encourages righteousness?
What if that ˹man˺ persists in denial and turns away?
Does he not know that Allah sees ˹all˺?
But no! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag him by the forelock—
a lying, sinful forelock.[1]
So let him call his associates.
We will call the wardens of Hell.
Again, no! Never obey him ˹O Prophet˺! Rather, ˹continue to˺ prostrate and draw near ˹to Allah˺.
