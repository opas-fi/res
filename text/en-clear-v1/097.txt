In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ sent this ˹Quran˺ down on the Night of Glory.[1]
And what will make you realize what the Night of Glory is?
The Night of Glory is better than a thousand months.
That night the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit[1] descend, by the permission of their Lord, for every ˹decreed˺ matter.
It is all peace until the break of dawn.
