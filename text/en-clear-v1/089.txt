In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
By the dawn,[1]
and the ten nights,[1]
and the even and the odd,
and the night when it passes!
Is all this ˹not˺ a sufficient oath for those who have sense?
Did you not see how your Lord dealt with ’Ȃd—
˹the people˺ of Iram—with ˹their˺ great stature,
unmatched in any other land;
and Thamûd who carved ˹their homes into˺ the rocks in the ˹Stone˺ Valley;
and the Pharaoh of mighty structures?[1]
They all transgressed throughout the land,
spreading much corruption there.
So your Lord unleashed on them a scourge of punishment.[1]
˹For˺ your Lord is truly vigilant.
Now, whenever a human being is tested by their Lord through ˹His˺ generosity and blessings, they boast, “My Lord has ˹deservedly˺ honoured me!”
But when He tests them by limiting their provision, they protest, “My Lord has ˹undeservedly˺ humiliated me!”
Absolutely not! In fact, you are not ˹even˺ gracious to the orphan,
nor do you urge one another to feed the poor.
And you devour ˹others’˺ inheritance greedily,[1]
and love wealth fervently.
Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed over and over,
and your Lord comes ˹to judge˺ with angels, rank upon rank,
and Hell is brought forth on that Day—this is when every ˹disbelieving˺ person will remember ˹their own sins˺. But what is the use of remembering then?
They will cry, “I wish I had sent forth ˹something good˺ for my ˹true˺ life.”
On that Day He will punish ˹them˺ severely, like no other,
and bind ˹them˺ tightly, like no other.[1]
˹Allah will say to the righteous,˺ “O tranquil soul!
Return to your Lord, well pleased ˹with Him˺ and well pleasing ˹to Him˺.
So join My servants,
and enter My Paradise.”
