In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
The Striking Disaster!
What is the Striking Disaster?
And what will make you realize what the Striking Disaster is?
˹It is˺ the Day people will be like scattered moths,
and the mountains will be like carded wool.
So as for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺,
they will be in a life of bliss.
And as for those whose scale is light,
their home will be the abyss.
And what will make you realize what that is?
˹It is˺ a scorching Fire.
