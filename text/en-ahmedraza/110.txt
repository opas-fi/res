Allah - beginning with the name of - the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
When the help and victory of Allah come,
And you see people entering the religion of Allah in multitudes,
Then proclaim the Purity of your Lord while praising Him, and seek forgiveness from Him; indeed He is the Most Acceptor of Repentance.
