In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Have We not lifted up your heart,
and removed your burden
that weighed so heavily on your back, and
have We not given you high renown?
So, surely with every hardship there is ease;
surely, with every hardship there is ease.
So, when you are free, strive hard,
and to your Lord turn [all] your attention.
